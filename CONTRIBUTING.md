# Contributing to Blaster

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Filing Issues

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or ask questions. Please include:
- A clear description of the problem or request
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Device/simulator and iOS version (for UI issues)

## Opening Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Branch naming convention: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
3. Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR.
4. Ensure the build passes before submitting:
   ```sh
   xcodebuild -scheme "claudeBlast" -configuration Debug build
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```sh
   xcodebuild -project claudeBlast.xcodeproj -scheme "claudeBlast" \
     -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro 11-inch (M5),OS=26.2" test
   ```
6. Open a PR against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why.
