//  Tier 2: the LLM judge. Where Tier 1 is a deterministic floor, Tier 2 is the
//  semi-subjective quality read — the thing we actually want. A stronger model
//  (the "judge", decoupled from the "subject" under test) scores output against
//  a rubric and, for escalation, makes the pairwise "is rung k more insistent
//  than k-1, same want?" call that the volume-knob hypothesis lives or dies on.
//
//  The judge is asked for STRICT JSON so verdicts parse and aggregate. Scores
//  are compared run-over-run in aggregate (means / pass-rates) — never as exact
//  text — because the judge, like any model, is non-deterministic.
