//  Enforces the norm from the Playful-3D work: anything we ship must be complete.
//  Every ImageSetID marked `isShippable` must provide real art for every key in
//  the bundled vocabulary — no relying on the master-set backfill or the
//  letter-on-color placeholder to paper over gaps. Incomplete sets (High
//  Contrast today) are `isShippable == false` and are exempt until reviewed +
//  regenerated. Runs offline (tests are app-hosted, so Bundle.main is the app
//  bundle and the tile PNGs + vocabulary.json are present).
