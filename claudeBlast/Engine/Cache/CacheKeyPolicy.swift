//
//  Single source of truth for SentenceCache identity + eviction policy.
//
//  The cached sentence for a tile combination depends on more than the tile
//  keys: it depends on the *model* that generated it, the *prompt* version that
//  shaped it, the child's *grade* (the system prompt embeds "{grade}"), and each
//  tile's *word class* (the prompt annotates every tile — "pony (animal)" vs
//  "pony (object)" — and the category-honor rule makes that annotation
//  authoritative). The cache key folds in all of them, so a model swap, a prompt
//  change, a grade difference, or a vocabulary *reclassification* stops serving
//  stale outputs instead of returning a sentence built under the old meaning.
//
//  `nonisolated` throughout: this is a pure policy helper (constants + pure
//  functions) and must be callable from any isolation domain — including the
//  `@Model` initializer and the nonisolated default-argument context of
//  `evictStale`.
